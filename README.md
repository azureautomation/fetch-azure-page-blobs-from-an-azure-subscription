Fetch Azure Page Blobs from an Azure subscription
=================================================

            

This script fetches the details of PAGE BLOB across the Azure subscription and saves it as a CSV file. The CSV file will be saved under the location from where the script was run.


The general use case could be to understand how many VHD files are present in your subscription. These could be your OS Disks, Datadisks or your VM snapshots.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
